all the things we can change to improve the bloody regressor:

- step_time: has the form from 1 to 20 ms, basically change steptime at which sum of
 spikes for electrodes is taken
- differesent sets of best electrodes
- dim_reducer: combines electrodes
- W (in position Estimator training) try 1:10, width of the gaussian (width is actually inverse of the width)
%- k number of gaussian functions per dimension change to the power by multiplication
